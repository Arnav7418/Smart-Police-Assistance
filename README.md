# Smart Police Assistance

Welcome to the Smart Police Assistance project. This project leverages computer vision and Flask to provide real-time monitoring and alerting for distress signals detected through CCTV cameras. It integrates with a Telegram bot to notify police and update their database, enhancing their ability to respond quickly and effectively.

## Project Description

Real-time monitoring of public spaces is crucial for maintaining safety and responding to emergencies promptly. The Smart Police Assistance website is designed to enhance police capabilities by analyzing video feeds from CCTV cameras to detect distress signals. When a distress signal is detected, the system sends a notification to the police via a Telegram bot and updates their database with relevant information, including a photo and real-time location.

### Key Features:

1. **Real-Time Video Analysis**: The website processes video feeds from CCTV cameras in real-time to detect distress signals using computer vision techniques.
2. **Automated Alerts**: Upon detecting a distress signal, the system sends an immediate notification to the police's Telegram bot.
3. **Database Integration**: The police database is updated automatically with information about the detected distress signal, including a photo of the scene.
4. **Telegram Bot Notifications**: Notifications sent to the Telegram bot include a photo of the sender and a real-time location link that can be opened in Google Maps.
5. **Police Action Management**: Police officers can view the updated database and take appropriate actions based on the information provided. They also have the capability to update the database with their actions and responses.
6. **Hosted on Flask**: The entire system is hosted on a Flask web server, ensuring a robust and scalable deployment.

By integrating advanced computer vision with real-time notification systems, the Smart Police Assistance project aims to significantly improve the responsiveness and efficiency of police forces in managing and responding to emergencies.
